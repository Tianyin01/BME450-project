##Project description

  Object shape classification is an important problem in computer vision. However, accurately classifying objects with similar shapes can be challenging, as subtle differences between objects can be difficult to detect. This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify images containing objects with similar shapes, specifically images of carrots and rockets. The model is built using PyTorch and will be trained on a dataset of labeled images. The proposed deep learning model will use convolutional neural network to extract relevant features from the input images. The CNN will consist of several convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality of the extracted features. The output of the CNN will be fed into a fully connected layer that will produce a classification label. The dataset used to train the model will consist of images of carrots and rockets. The dataset will be labeled with the corresponding object in the image. The images will be preprocessed to ensure they are all of the same size and format. The model would be trained with backpropagation to improve the performance of the model.
